# Submissions — how to submit

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.json` to a new file named: `<Your-Full-Name-With-Underscores>_<Type>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`
   - Name must match `fellows.csv` (case-insensitive), e.g. `Arjun_A`.
   - Type must be one of: PurchaseProof, Blog, Linkedin, X, Project, Workshop, Documentation contribution, Video, Fellowship Referral, Bug, Referral.
   - **First PR must be PurchaseProof**: your dev-kit proof (board photo / invoice image link). Title it `[PurchaseProof] Your Name`. Until accepted, Kit shows NO in the score block.
2. Fill all fields. Link must start with http:// or https://.
   - `github`: your GitHub username/URL (the account opening the PR). It must map to your `fellow` name via `fellows.csv` or `github_overrides.json` — points always go to the `fellow` name, never to the raw account. A mismatch fails CI.
3. Open a Pull Request. PR title format (important):
   `[PurchaseProof]` (first PR only) `[Blog]` `[Linkedin]` `[X]` `[Project]` `[Workshop]` `[Documentation contribution]` `[Video]` `[Fellowship Referral]` `[Bug]` `[Referral]`
4. One submission = one JSON file = one PR (easier to accept/reject). Do not bundle multiple links in one file.
5. If maintainer merges, points auto-allocate. If closed, no points.

## Single-name listing (auto-generated)
- [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) — all accepted submissions grouped under a single fellow name (`## Name - N submission(s), P pts` + bullet per link). Start here to browse.
- [`INDEX.json`](INDEX.json) — same data, machine-readable (`{ "Fellow Name": [{type, points, title, link, date, file}] }`).
- Both regenerate on every merge. Do not hand-edit (overwritten). Ignored as input by the scorer.

Example file: `Arjun_A_Blog_2026-09-28.json`
```json
{
  "fellow": "Arjun A",
  "type": "Blog",
  "title": "My Axon Lite build log",
  "link": "https://medium.com/@arjun/my-axon-build",
  "date": "2026-09-28"
}
```
